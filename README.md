# angular-demo
Demo SPA using Angular2

This project demonstrates a partially developed Angular 2 SPA front end that can use REST APIs for repository and game engine interfaces. The concept for the game is based upon interesting social interactions within teams as well as between teams.

Though the front end currently uses a local JSON input, a .NET Core 2 project for an initial repository has been tested. If time permits, this may change to use the repository from the cloud. 

Of interest are the following:

1. Overall layout and design of the web page (including links at the bottom that are mostly place holders at this time).
2. Animated SVGs on the Situation Room page.
3. Layout & functionality of the game documentation pages.
